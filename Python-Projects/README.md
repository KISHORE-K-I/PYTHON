# 🎨 Color Recognition using Python & OpenCV

This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect and recognize colors in real-time from a webcam feed. When you hover your mouse over any point in the frame, the program displays the RGB values and attempts to identify the color name dynamically.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time color detection via webcam
- 🖱 Displays RGB values on mouse hover
- 🎨 Identifies nearest color name from a dataset
- 🧠 Simple logic using OpenCV and NumPy

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## 📚 How It Works

Captures live video from your webcam.

Listens for mouse events to detect pixel position.

Fetches the RGB values at the pixel.

Maps RGB values to the closest known color (from a CSV or hardcoded list).

Displays the result directly on the video window in real-time.
