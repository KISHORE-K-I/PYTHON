## 🔷 Python Projects

### 🎨 Color Recognition using Python & OpenCV

This project detects and recognizes colors in real-time using OpenCV and Python. When the mouse hovers over any point in the video feed, it displays the RGB value and name of the color.

📌 **Features:**
- Real-time color detection using webcam
- Displays color name and RGB values dynamically
- Easy to use with minimal dependencies

📦 **Technologies Used:**
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

🚀 **How to Run:**
\`\`\`bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
python color_recognition.py
\`\`\`
